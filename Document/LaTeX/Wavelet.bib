	abstract = {A crucial component of steerable wavelets is the radial profile of the generating function in the frequency domain. In this paper, we present an infinite-dimensional optimization scheme that helps us find the optimal profile for a given criterion over the space of tight frames. We consider two classes of criteria that measure the localization of the wavelet. The first class specifies the spatial localization of the wavelet profile, and the second that of the resulting wavelet coefficients. From these metrics and the proposed algorithm, we construct tight wavelet frames that are optimally localized and provide their analytical expression. In particular, one of the considered criterion helps us finding back the popular Simoncelli wavelet profile. Finally, the investigation of local orientation estimation, image reconstruction from detected contours in the wavelet domain, and denoising indicate that optimizing wavelet localization improves the performance of steerable wavelets, since our new wavelets outperform the traditional ones.},

	abstract = {Wavelets are mathematical functions that cut up data into diÆerent frequency com-
ponents,  and  then  study  each  component  with  a  resolution  matched  to  its  scale.   They  have  ad-
vantages over traditional Fourier methods in analyzing physical situations where the signal contains
discontinuities and sharp spikes.  Wavelets were developed independently in the Øelds of mathemat-
ics, quantum physics, electrical engineering, and seismic geology.  Interchanges between these Øelds
during  the  last  ten  years  have  led  to  many  new
wavelet  applications  such  as  image  compression,
turbulence, human vision, radar, and earthquake prediction.  This paper introduces
wavelets to the
interested technical person outside of the digital signal processing Øeld.  I describe the history of
wavelets beginning with Fourier, compare
wavelet transforms with Fourier transforms, state prop-
erties and other special aspects of
wavelets,  and Ønish with some interesting applications such as
image compression, musical tones, and de-noising noisy data},

	abstract = {Wavelet theory had its origin in quantum field theory, signal analysis, and function space theory. In these areas wavelet-like algorithms replace the classical Fourier-type expansion of a function. This unique new book is an excellent introduction to the basic properties of wavelets, from background math to powerful applications. The authors provide elementary methods for constructing wavelets, and illustrate several new classes of wavelets. The text begins with a description of local sine and cosine bases that have been shown to be very effective in applications. Very little mathematical background is needed to follow this material. A complete treatment of band-limited wavelets follows. These are characterized by some elementary equations, allowing the authors to introduce many new wavelets. Next, the idea of multiresolution analysis (MRA) is developed, and the authors include simplified presentations of previous studies, particularly for compactly supported wavelets.Some of the topics treated include:Several bases generated by a single function via translations and dilationsMultiresolution analysis, compactly supported wavelets, and spline waveletsBand-limited waveletsUnconditionality of wavelet basesCharacterizations of many of the principal objects in the theory of wavelets, such as low-pass filters and scaling functionsThe authors also present the basic philosophy that all orthonormal wavelets are completely characterized by two simple equations, and that most properties and constructions of wavelets can be developed using these two equations. Material related to applications is provided, and constructions of splines wavelets are presented. Mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and anyone with a mathematical background will find this to be an important text for furthering their studies on wavelets.},

Wavelets are a mathematical development that many experts think may revolutionize the world of information storage and retrieval. They are a fairly simple mathematical tool now being applied to the compression of data, such as fingerprints, weather satellite photographs, and medical x-rays - that were previously thought to be impossible to condense without losing crucial details. The opening chapter provides an overview of the main problems presented in the book. Following chapters discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of wavelet theory, including wavelet transforms, orthonormal bases of wavelets, and characterization of functional spaces by means of wavelets. The last chapter presents several topics under active research, as multidimensional wavelets, wavelet packet bases, and a construction of wavelets tailored to decompose functions defined in a finite interval.},
