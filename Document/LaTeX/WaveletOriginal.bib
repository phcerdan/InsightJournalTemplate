	abstract = {Wavelets are mathematical functions that cut up data into diÆerent frequency com-
ponents,  and  then  study  each  component  with  a  resolution  matched  to  its  scale.   They  have  ad-
vantages over traditional Fourier methods in analyzing physical situations where the signal contains
discontinuities and sharp spikes.  Wavelets were developed independently in the Øelds of mathemat-
ics, quantum physics, electrical engineering, and seismic geology.  Interchanges between these Øelds
during  the  last  ten  years  have  led  to  many  new
wavelet  applications  such  as  image  compression,
turbulence, human vision, radar, and earthquake prediction.  This paper introduces
wavelets to the
interested technical person outside of the digital signal processing Øeld.  I describe the history of
wavelets beginning with Fourier, compare
wavelet transforms with Fourier transforms, state prop-
erties and other special aspects of
wavelets,  and Ønish with some interesting applications such as
image compression, musical tones, and de-noising noisy data},

	abstract = {Wavelet theory had its origin in quantum field theory, signal analysis, and function space theory. In these areas wavelet-like algorithms replace the classical Fourier-type expansion of a function. This unique new book is an excellent introduction to the basic properties of wavelets, from background math to powerful applications. The authors provide elementary methods for constructing wavelets, and illustrate several new classes of wavelets. The text begins with a description of local sine and cosine bases that have been shown to be very effective in applications. Very little mathematical background is needed to follow this material. A complete treatment of band-limited wavelets follows. These are characterized by some elementary equations, allowing the authors to introduce many new wavelets. Next, the idea of multiresolution analysis (MRA) is developed, and the authors include simplified presentations of previous studies, particularly for compactly supported wavelets.Some of the topics treated include:Several bases generated by a single function via translations and dilationsMultiresolution analysis, compactly supported wavelets, and spline waveletsBand-limited waveletsUnconditionality of wavelet basesCharacterizations of many of the principal objects in the theory of wavelets, such as low-pass filters and scaling functionsThe authors also present the basic philosophy that all orthonormal wavelets are completely characterized by two simple equations, and that most properties and constructions of wavelets can be developed using these two equations. Material related to applications is provided, and constructions of splines wavelets are presented. Mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and anyone with a mathematical background will find this to be an important text for furthering their studies on wavelets.},

They are a fairly simple mathematical tool now being applied to the compression of data, such as fingerprints, weather satellite photographs, and medical x-rays - that were previously thought to be impossible to condense without losing crucial details. The opening chapter provides an overview of the main problems presented in the book. Following chapters discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of wavelet theory, including wavelet transforms, orthonormal bases of wavelets, and characterization of functional spaces by means of wavelets. The last chapter presents several topics under active research, as multidimensional wavelets, wavelet packet bases, and a construction of wavelets tailored to decompose functions defined in a finite interval.},

In this paper, we present an infinite-dimensional optimization scheme that helps us find the optimal profile for a given criterion over the space of tight frames. We consider two classes of criteria that measure the localization of the wavelet. The first class specifies the spatial localization of the wavelet profile, and the second that of the resulting wavelet coefficients. From these metrics and the proposed algorithm, we construct tight wavelet frames that are optimally localized and provide their analytical expression. In particular, one of the considered criterion helps us finding back the popular Simoncelli wavelet profile. Finally, the investigation of local orientation estimation, image reconstruction from detected contours in the wavelet domain, and denoising indicate that optimizing wavelet localization improves the performance of steerable wavelets, since our new wavelets outperform the traditional ones.},

The goal of this paper is to build optimal junction detectors based on 2D steerable wavelets that are polar-separable in the Fourier domain. The approaches we develop are general and can be used for the detection of arbitrary symmetric and asymmetric junctions. The backbone of our construction is a multiscale pyramid with a radial wavelet function where the directional components are represented by circular harmonics and encoded in a shaping matrix. We are able to detect M-fold junctions in different scales and orientations. We provide experimental results on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share a hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping “pictures”. We hope that this paper will contribute to the appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in image understanding.},

First, it generalizes the minimal length K-regular 2-band wavelets of Daubechies (1988) to the M-band case by deriving explicit formulas for K-regular M-band scaling filters. Several equivalent characterizations of K-regularity are given and their significance explained. Second, two approaches to the construction of the (M-1) wavelet filters and associated wavelet bases are described; one relies on a state-space characterization with a novel technique to obtain the unitary wavelet filters; the other uses a factorization approach. Third, this paper gives a set of necessary and sufficient condition on the M-band scaling filter for it to generate an orthonormal wavelet basis. The conditions are very similar to those obtained by Cohen (1990) and Lawton (1990) for 2-band wavelets},

In this paper, discrete wavelet transform has been adopted in order to enhance the reliability of optical flow estimation. A generalization of the well-known dyadic orthonormal wavelets to the case of the dilation scale factor M {\textgreater} 2 with N vanishing moments has been used, and it has proved to be a useful regularizing tool. The advantages in the computations have been shown by experimental results performed on real image sequences.},

	abstract = {Future cosmological surveys will provide 3D large scale structure maps with large sky coverage, for which a 3D Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) analysis in spherical coordinates is natural. Wavelets are particularly well-suited to the analysis and denoising of cosmological data, but a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform does not currently exist to analyse spherical 3D data. The aim of this paper is to present a new formalism for a spherical 3D isotropic wavelet, i.e. one based on the SFB decomposition of a 3D field and accompany the formalism with a public code to perform wavelet transforms. We describe a new 3D isotropic spherical wavelet decomposition based on the undecimated wavelet transform (UWT) described in Starck et al. 2006. We also present a new fast Discrete Spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform (DSFBT) based on both a discrete Bessel Transform and the HEALPIX angular pixelisation scheme. We test the 3D wavelet transform and as a toy-application, apply a denoising algorithm in wavelet space to the Virgo large box cosmological simulations and find we can successfully remove noise without much loss to the large scale structure. We have described a new spherical 3D isotropic wavelet transform, ideally suited to analyse and denoise future 3D spherical cosmological surveys, which uses a novel Discrete Spherical Fourier-Bessel Transform. We illustrate its potential use for denoising using a toy model. All the algorithms presented in this paper are available for download as a public code called MRS3D at http://jstarck.free.fr/mrs3d.html},

	abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of orthogonal wavelet transforms is their lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal and, in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. The authors formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds to a lack of aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be applied in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale. Jointly shiftable transforms that are simultaneously shiftable in more than one domain are explored. Two examples of jointly shiftable transforms are designed and implemented: a 1-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and scale, and a 2-D transform that is jointly shiftable in position and orientation. The usefulness of these image representations for scale-space analysis, stereo disparity measurement, and image enhancement is demonstrated.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The signature is defined as the fine-scale limit of the signs of a signal's complex wavelet coefficients. We show that the signature equals zero at sufficiently regular points of a signal whereas at salient features, such as jumps or cusps, it is non-zero. At such feature points, the orientation of the signature in the complex plane can be interpreted as an indicator of local symmetry and antisymmetry. We establish that the signature rotates in the complex plane under fractional Hilbert transforms. We show that certain random signals, such as white Gaussian noise and Brownian motions, have a vanishing signature. We derive an appropriate discretization and show the applicability to signal analysis.},

	abstract = {We introduce a complete parameterization of the family of two-dimensional steerable wavelets that are polar-separable in the Fourier domain under the constraint of self-reversibility. These wavelets are constructed by multiorder generalized Riesz transformation of a primary isotropic bandpass pyramid. The backbone of the transform (pyramid) is characterized by a radial frequency profile function \$h({\textbackslash}omega)\$, while the directional wavelet components at each scale are encoded by an \$M {\textbackslash}times (2N+1)\$ shaping matrix \$\{{\textbackslash}bf U\}\$, where \$M\$ is the number of wavelet channels and \$N\$ the order of the Riesz transform. We provide general conditions on \$h({\textbackslash}omega)\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}bf U\}\$ for the underlying wavelet system to form a tight frame of \$L\_2({\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}2)\$ (with a redundancy factor \$4/3M\$). The proposed framework ensures that the wavelets are steerable and provides new degrees of freedom (shaping matrix \$\{{\textbackslash}bf U\}\$) that can be exploited for designing specific wavelet systems. It encompasses many known transforms as particular cases: Simoncelli's steerable pyramid, Marr gradient and Hessian wavelets, monogenic wavelets, and \$N\$th-order Riesz and circular harmonic wavelets. We take advantage of the framework to construct new generalized spheroidal prolate wavelets, whose angular selectivity is maximized, as well as signal-adapted detectors based on principal component analysis. We also introduce a curvelet-like steerable wavelet system. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of some of the designs for signal denoising, feature extraction, pattern analysis, and source separation.},
